# In Python,variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout a programe.
# A variable is created the moment you assign a value to it using the assigment operator (=)

# RULES OF DEFINING VARIABLE
# Variable name must start from a letter (a-z , A-Z) # or an underscore (_)
#they must contain lettters,numbers, and underscores 
# Variables names are case-sensetive (age and Age are different)
# Avoid using python keywords  (e.g. , if, for, while) as variable names.
