# THERE ARE TWO METHODS OF DOING THIS LONG METHOD AND SHORTCUT METHOD BOTH ARE GIVEN BELOW






square = lambda x : x*x

# as good as writing(LONG)  
# def square(x):
#     return x*x


sum    = lambda x, y: x+y

# as good as writing(LONG)
# def sum (x, y):
#     return x + y


print(square(12))
print(sum(12,24))
