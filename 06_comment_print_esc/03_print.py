print('hello world' , "neeraj" , 5 , "kaise ho")         
                      #we can wrint multi thing in one print (by using ,)


 #we are using it because we are not demanding another line i only want statemnt in one line
 # so we use (,comma) in betwwen character 
 # now we see the difference betwwen the 2 codes 
 # 
 # 
print("hello world")                        #when we run this we can see that 
                                            #the both sentence are written in 2 lines
print("my name is neeraj")                   
                                #------>>               #RESULT (RUN)
                                                # hello world
                                                # my name is neeraj

#BUT BY USING THE , WE CAN PRINT MULTIPLE THING IN ONE PRINT AND IN ONE LINE





#VERY IMPORTANT I WANT TO USE ;'\][]\..,/ INSTEAD OF SPACE BETWWEN THE CHARACTER 
#SO I USE A COMMAND KNOWN AS     [         sep=""    ] anything b\w the "" is cover the space b\w the cahracters 


#and if i want to add ::.,/-].. in the last of sentence we can use
# a command known as [        end=""              ] anything b\w ""printed in end


# example of this 

print('hello world ' , " my self neeraj" , sep=";")
                                                     #all things are viwed by running codes
print('hello world' , end="..")
print('are you ok')
